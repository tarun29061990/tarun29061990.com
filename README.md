I have coded this in Ember.js and used little bit of ajax and PHP for contact thing. Css sprites and css transitions made it nicer and used facebook graph api for my image, So if I will change my Facebook Profile pic then the image on my webpage will update automatically... have a look ... I also used google analytics to keep track of users visiting my site... you can use this code to learn how routing take place in ember.js .. I have used saas and compass for styling...

It is an old version of my webpage and Now I have changed the whole design and made it responsive. So if you want to learn emberjs and learn how templating works then you can use this code. Simply clone it and use it.
