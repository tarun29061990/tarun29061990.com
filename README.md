So Finally My wepage is up and running at www.tarun29061990.com 

I have coded this in Ember.js and used little bit of ajax and PHP for contact thing. Css sprites and css transitions made it nicer and used facebook graph api for my image, So if I will change my Facebook Profile pic then the image on my webpage will update automatically... have a look ... you can use this code to learn how routing take place in ember.js .. I have used saas and compass for styling...
